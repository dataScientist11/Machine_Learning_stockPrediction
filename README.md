# stockPrediction

### For this project the dependencies I used were: 

from sklearn.grid_search import GridSearchCV
from sklearn import grid_search
from sklearn import cross_validation
from sklearn.neighbors import KNeighborsClassifier
from sklearn import linear_model
from sklearn import neighbors
import numpy as np 
import pandas as pd
from sklearn.metrics import mean_squared_error
from sklearn.metrics import accuracy_score

Feel free to start a similar project as mine simply by copying and pasting the above into your project. Of course libraries can be added or taken out.
